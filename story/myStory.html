      <h4>Lynde Shores Conservation Area</h4>
      <h5>
        A: Lynde Shores Conservation Area is my favourite conservation area to
        go to. The reason so is because of the diversity of birds that you can
        see throughout the area; along with that, you can feed birds using the
        bird feed stations that are around the area. In addition, with mix of
        wetlands and forest there is an abundant of wildlife such as, but not
        limited to, deer, racoons, ducks, swans, blue herons (uncommon), and
        many more.
      </h5>
      <h4>Heber Down Conservation Area</h4>
      <h5>
        B: Coming in at number 2: Heber Down Conservation Area. This conservation
        area has many trails with unique terrain to choose from and hike on. These
        trails have a certain level of difficulty to them from low-slope and cleared
        pathways to steep-slopes and undefined pathways. This is one of the main reasons
        I love going to this area as hiking difficulties are varied for trail to trail
        which brings a good challenge. Aside from the previous, the area has no shortage
        of wildlife and because of its proximity, more territorial animals are present
        which provides great spotting and awe.
      </h5>
      <h4>Thicksons Woods</h4>
      <h5>
        C: This conservation area is nothing short of unique as trails and areas within
        are access on a quite steep slope. 
      </h5>
      <h4>Glen Major</h4>
      <h5>
