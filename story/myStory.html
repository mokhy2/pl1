      On this map, the markers are representing the conservation areas around my
      area and in fact I have visited over the past several years; also visiting
      them tens of times in that time frame.

    <div id="descOfPlaces">
      <h4>Lynde Shores Conservation Area</h4>
      <h5>
        A: Lynde Shores Conservation Area is my favourite conservation area to
        go to. The reason so is because of the diversity of birds that you can
        see throughout the area; along with that, you can feed birds using the
        bird feed stations that are around the area. In addition, with mix of
        wetlands and forest there is an abundant of wildlife such as, but not
        limited to, deer, racoons, ducks, swans, blue herons (uncommon), and
        many more.
      </h5>
      <h4>Heber Down Conservation Area</h4>
      <h5>
        B: Coming in at number 2: Heber Down Conservation Area. This conservation
        area has many trails with unique terrain to choose from and hike on. These
        trails have a certain level of difficulty to them from low-slope and cleared
        pathways to steep-slopes and undefined pathways. This is one of the main reasons
        I love going to this area as hiking difficulties are varied for trail to trail
        which brings a good challenge. Aside from the previous, the area has no shortage
        of wildlife and because of its proximity, more territorial animals are present
        which provides great spotting and awe.
      </h5>
      <h4>Thicksons Woods</h4>
      <h5>
        C: This conservation area is nothing short of unique as trails and areas within
        are accessed on quite a steep slope. This area is the best in my opinion to feed
        wild birds and other animals such as chipmunks and ducks. Another plus to this area
        is its open fields; not as much forested area as the other conservation areas, but
        does have wonderful meadows due to this feature which increases spotting opportunities.
      </h5>
      <h4>Glen Major</h4>
      <h5>
        D: Glen Major is the top on my list for trails in a variety of terrains and landscapes as
        it transitions from meadows, fields, creeks, and forest, all in one area. Wildlife in
        this area is one of the most diverse out of the bunch I have visited as it includes foxes,
        coyotes, and deer on a more common basis.
      </h5>
      <h4>Enniskillen Conservation Area</h4>
      <h5>
        E: Smaller in area than the other conservation areas in this list, it still packs a good
        punch when it comes to nature and trails. My favourite part of this area is the small ponds
        and creeks as they are filled with aquatic-life.
      </h5>
      <h4>Greenwood Conservation Area</h4>
      <h5>
        F: This one is my favourite for biking on the paved trails as it moves through forested and
        fielded areas, a nice scene for biking. In addition, the lookout points across the area brings
        amazing views of the surrounding area and creek system that runs through the area.
      </h5>
      <h4>Mark S. Burnham Provincial Park</h4>
      <h5>
        G: Really nice combination of terrain, is conservation area makes you feel small as the trees
        surrounding you while on the trails are massive. Even though this area I find doesn't have as
        much active wildlife as the other areas listed, it still has lots to offer.
      </h5>
      <h4>Harold Town Conservation Area</h4>
      <h5>
        H: Last but not least, this conservation area, even though doesn't have much trails, is densely
        forested with the most wildlife out of this list. Favourite part of this area is the terrain as
        it gives a cool perspective of the surrounding forest.
