        A: Lynde Shores Conservation Area is my favourite conservation area to
        go to. The reason so is because of the diversity of birds that you can
        see throughout the area; along with that, you can feed birds using the
        bird feed stations that are around the area. In addition, with mix of
        wetlands and forest there is an abundant of wildlife such as, but not
        limited to, deer, racoons, ducks, swans, blue herons (uncommon), and
        many more.
